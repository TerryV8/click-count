# Exploring the project structure

- The folder src is for your Java source code.

- The folder web is for the web part of your application. At the moment this folder contains the deployment descriptor WEB-INF\web.xml.

- External Libraries include your JDK and the JAR files for working with the GlassFish Server.

# Examining the generated artifact configuration

The word artifact in IntelliJ IDEA may mean one of the following:

The available artifact configurations are shown in the central pane under icons general add svg and icons general remove svg. Currently there is only one configuration rest_glassfish_hello_world:war exploded, it is a decompressed web application archive (WAR), a directory structure that is ready for deployment onto a web server.

The artifact settings are shown in the right-hand pane of the dialog:
