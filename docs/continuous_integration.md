# Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration is the practice of frequently merging code changes.

But frequent merges cause difficulties:
- What if the code doesn't compile after a merge
- What if someone broke something
- It would be a lof of work to check these things on every merge

The solution is to automate this process.

## How CI works ?
We use a CI server which executes a build that automatically prepares/compiles the code and runs automated tests.

Usually, the CI server automatically detects code changes in source control and run the build whenever there is a change

If something is wrong, the build fails. The team can get immediate feedback if their change broke something. It can take in form of emails.

Merging frequently throughout the day and getting quick feedback means that if you broke something, you broke it with your changes within the last couple hours. This is much easier to identify/fix than if you broke something with your changes from a week ago!

We will be using Jenkins as our CI server.

## Setting up CI server

Let's set up Jenkins:
```console
sudo yum -y remove java
sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
sudo yum -y install jenkins-2.121.1
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

Go to <your server address>:8080 in a browser,
in my case, it is http://10.211.55.4:8080/
and on the home page, you will get this message:
```console
Unlock Jenkins
To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (not sure where to find it?) and this file on the server:
/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.
```

Thus on the server, copy/paste the password required that you can find in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Then, choose the default setting for the set up

Register the adminstrator account:
Username: jenkins
password: jenkins

After that, login to <your server address>:8080
in my case, http://10.211.55.4:8080.
In the case, there is an error, type the url <your server address>:8080/restart
  
 
## Setting up Jenkins Projects
Jenkins projects are at the core of doing any kind of automation in Jenkins. 
A Jenkins project is the configuration which controls what a piece of Jenkins automation does and when it executes.

It will demonstrate how to set up a freestyle project that pulls application source code from GitHub and executes build automation against it. 

We are going to set up a CI build for the train schedule app found at https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-jenkins.
- This build will check out the code from GitHub
- Run the gradle build automation that is packaged with the source code


Go your Jenkins homepage,
click on "New Item"
Enter the name for the jenkins project
Then choose "Freestyle project" as a project type
Now I am ready to set up my project to pull the source code from git.
From the source code management, select Git and paste the url from gitHub (https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-jenkins). I don't need to set up any crudential because this git repository is publicly readable.

Now, I go ahead and implementing my build step. Click on add build step
This build is a gradle build. So i am going to choose "invoke gradle script"
and call the gradle build that is built in source code. Now this source code used the gradle wrapper.
Put in Tasks: build. What is going to do is it will call "./gradlew build" to actually execute the gradle build

In the "post-build actions" section,
I am going to archive and artefact,
this particular build is going to generate a zip archive of the code
So I am going to archive as a jenkins artefact. So after the build runs, I can access the zip files that was created as a result of that build. So I am going to click on "Add post-build actions" and select "Archive the artefacts".
The zip file which is going to be generated by the gradle build is (Files to archive): dist/trainSchedule.zip.
